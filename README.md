# qframe-filter-inventory
Qframe filter which keeps an inventory and can be queried by other plugins.

**Depreciated!** Moved to [qframe/cache-inventory](https://github.com/qframe/cache-inventory)

## Prebuild Docker Image

The inventory filter listens for messages from the [`docker-events` plugin](https://github.com/qnib/qframe-collector-docker-events) and holds an inventory of all containers (of the engine reachable by `/var/run/docker.sock`)
which can be queried by other plugins using `qframe_inventory.InventoryRequest` messages on the `QChan.Data` channel.

An example run can be seen here:

```bash
$ docker run -ti --name qframe-filter-inventory --rm \                                                                                                                                                                                      git:(masterâ†‘1|)
             -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock qnib/qframe-filter-inventory

```

What is going on here:

- In line 5-7 `SearcRequest for name TestCnt.*` the `main.go` creates two search requests which are submitted directly to to the inventory queue, the third is send to the Data-channel.
  As the containers are not yet started, they are added to the `Inventory.PendingRequests` array.
- When the first container is started in line 9, it triggers a message to the `docker-events` collector, which subsequently ends up in the Inventory of `filter-inventory`
- The ticker generates a tick-event in line 12, which results in a run of [CheckRequests](https://github.com/qnib/qframe-inventory/blob/master/lib/inventory.go#L81) and results in a response of the requests Back channel.
- In line 14 and 19 the last two containers are started, the search can be fulfilled and results in a count-down to an empty Request-queue `SUCCESS > Request: /TestCnt21493583397 (length of PendingRequests: 0)`

After that the PendingRequest list is empty and the command will exit.
